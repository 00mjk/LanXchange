LanXchange
==========

Ever tried to copy files from one computer to another? What if your flash drive is full or vanished again?

LanXchange uses your local (wifi-)network to transfer files and folder directly, without DVDs or flash drives.

It is very simple to use, you only have to launch the application and drag files into the window on one computer to offer them.
When you start LanXchange on another computer, those files will be detected automatically and show up on the screen.
Just click them and the transfer starts immediately.
