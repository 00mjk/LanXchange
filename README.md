LanXchange
==========

Ever tried to copy files from one computer to another? What if your flash drive is full or vanished again?

LanXchange uses your local (wifi-)network to transfer files and folder directly, without DVDs or flash drives.

LanXchange is very simple to use, just drag files into the window on one computer to make them available in your home network.
When started on other computers, LanXchange automatically detects those files.
Your transfer starts after a simple click.

--------

* Does not require any setup
* Automatically detects files offered by other computers and displays them
